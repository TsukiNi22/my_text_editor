### My own text editor "Banana Writer" with his executable "bw" standing for BananaWriter
## Description

The "Banana" of the name "Banana Writer" is a private joke and the "Writer" is just here because that sound good even if it's a text editor

This text editor is based on `vi`, `vim` and `nvim`, with some difference and some other thing in more, i designed it has how i wanted it to be and with what i wanted.
